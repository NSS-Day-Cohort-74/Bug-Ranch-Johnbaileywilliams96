# Welcome to Bug Wrangler Ranch

This first self-assessment is for you to hone several Core Skills that you need as a software developer.

Taking your time now to be thorough, reflective, patient and curious will give you the foundation to be successful throughout the rest of this course and your career.

If you rush this, or think of it as a test to be "passed", then you will already be on the wrong path.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Description

Slim Jenkins offers a vacation package for people who have always wanted to join a cattle driving team across the American Midwest.

He calls it the **Kansas Slim's Cattle Adventure**.

People join a team of experienced drovers who will train them in the basics of herding cattle and driving them across hundreds of miles to their destination at Old Red's Ranch.

Unfortunately, someone gained access to the code that produces an outline of the adventure to the paying customers, so Slim has hired you to examine and fix the code.

## Learning Objectives

Here are your learning objectives for this self-assessment.

1. Able to use the debugger to step through existing code to discover root causes of bugs.
2. Drawing a sequence diagram for a project.
   > Use the [sequencediagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/) site to generate your sequence diagram. Make sure you save your work as you go.
3. Demonstrate learning efficiency by researching concepts you haven't seen before using your peers, mentors, and the World Wide Web as resources.
4. Awareness of when you need help, and then seeking it out.

## Example Output

If you are able to fix all of the bugs, you will output similar to what is below. It will not be identical, but similar.

You will be accompanying 5 drovers as they drive 50 cattle to Old Red's Ranch for grazing

The herd is made of up the following types of cattle:
Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,American Angus,Brown Swiss,
Ankina,American Angus,Ankina,Brown Swiss,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,
Brown Swiss,American Angus,Ankina,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,

Here is the team of drovers you will be joining
        * Melvyn Hethron
        * Yancy Gresley
        * Willabella Attarge
        * Ynes Gyenes
        * Farlie Spere


Your journey will take you through the wildness of the American Midwest and across the following terrain
        * forest
        * plain
        * river
        * mountain
```

1. In the **main** module, one of the first lines of code is `const drovers = hireDrovers(cattleToDrive)`. Explain what the value of the `drovers` variable is when that line of code runs.
   > We're setting `drovers` equal to the `hireDrovers` function which is taking the total herd of 50 and dividing it by 10 thus giving us a team of 5 drovers. The for loop in the function is returning a random array of drovers from the database and the amount in the array is dependent on the herd size which in this case is 50 thus 5 random drovers are selected.   
2. At the bottom of the main module, you will see the following code - `for (const drover of drovers)`. Explain what the values of both the `drover` and the `drovers` variables are.
   > The for loop is iterating through the `Drovers` array and is printing the `first_name` and `last_name` of the five drovers being selected using interpolation. `Drovers` is the entire array and `Drover` is each drover being iterated. 
3. In the **journey** module, there is a `journeyMaker()` function. In that function, there is a variable named `areas` which will have the value of an object. Use your debugger to show what the value of each key is on that object. Use [Loom](https://www.loom.com) to record your session.
   > https://www.loom.com/share/3589cecfa9484eba94dfcf332451fd7e 
4. Also in the **journey** module, there is the following code:
   ```js
   for (let forestNumber = 0; forestNumber < areas.forests; forestNumber++) {
      journey.push("forest")
   }
   ```
   Explain this code with your best vocabulary.//****
   >The loop is set whithin the journeyMaker function  .creating a for loop that is initilizing forestNumber to 0, stopping the forestNumber at areas.forest, and adding forestNumber by itself. then pushing the string "forest" into the empty array at the top of the function. the `createForests` function is generating a random number telling the for loop to iterate a certain number of times creating multiple forests or just one. 
5. Explain the value of the `database` variable in the **database** module. Be as comprehensive as possible.
   > The Database variable contains the cattleTypes array of 4 objects and the drovers array containg 50 objects. the `cattleTypes` array contains the properties of id and breed, while the drovers array contains the id, first_name, last_name, and gender properties.  
6. In the **drovers** module, there is a `hireDrovers()` function. You will notice the following code on that line - `(herdSize)`. What is that defining, and where does it get its value?
   > The function is accessing the alldrovers array and selecting 5 randomHerderId's. since herdSize is set to 50 this means that `numberNeeded` is equal to 5, thus the iterative loop will stop once 5 iterations have taken place. everytime a loop occurs a random drover is selected because of the randomHerderId. finally all the random drovers selected are pushed up and stored into the drovers empty array which is then returned at the bottom of the function. 

## When You Are Done

After you have answered all the questions above, you need to push all of your code back up to Github. Follow these instructions.

1. Be in the `bug-wrangler-ranch` directory.
2. `git add --all`
3. `git commit -m "Code complete"`
4. `git push origin main`

Then go to the Learning Platform and click the **Self-assessment Complete** button.
